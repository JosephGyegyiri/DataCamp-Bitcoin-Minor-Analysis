# 📈 Cryptocurrency Minor Analysis 🚀


## 🎯 Objectives

Since the [launch of Bitcoin in 2008](https://newfronttest.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf), hundreds of similar projects based on blockchain technology have emerged. These projects, known as cryptocurrencies (or coins/cryptos in internet slang), vary in value and potential. Some are valuable today, while others have the potential to become valuable in the future<sup>1</sup>. For instance, on December 6th, 2017, Bitcoin's [market capitalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization) exceeded $200 billion.

*The astonishing increase in Bitcoin's market capitalization in 2017.*

*<sup>1</sup> **WARNING**: The cryptocurrency market is exceptionally volatile<sup>2</sup>, and any invested funds could be lost. The cryptocurrencies mentioned here **might be scams** or have other issues (e.g., overvaluation, technical problems). **This is not investment advice**.*

*<sup>2</sup> **Update on March 2020**: As it turns out, volatility became a reality :D*

Now, let's dive into the project. We'll begin with a CSV file we conveniently downloaded on December 6th, 2017, using the coinmarketcap API (Note: The public API was made private in 2020 and is no longer accessible). The file is named `datasets/coinmarketcap_06122017.csv`.
